  <p>Most days I feel like a child with an old soul.</p>
</header>

<p>I am Sheila.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Jesus.</p>
<p>Wife to Alex.</p>
<p>Software developer most days, poet some days.  </p>
<p>I love words and coffee, I have it black these days. </p>
<p>Music. Folk. Acoustic.</p>
<p>Working out keeps me sane. </p>
<p>I love hats, but it's almost always windy here, so I don't get to wear them that often.</p>
<p>I haven't always loved poetry, but the Romanian poet Nichita StÄƒnescu has definitely been a contributing factor. Also, my Romanian teacher in college, Mrs. Stroe.</p>
