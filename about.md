## About

<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/about_sheila.jpg" | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>

<p>I am Sheila.</p>
<p> Most days I feel like a child with an old soul.</p>
<p>Follower of Jesus.</p>
<p>Wife to Alex.</p>
<p>Software developer most days, poet some days.  </p>
<p>I love words and coffee, I have it black these days. </p>
<p>Music. Folk. Acoustic.</p>
<p>Working out keeps me sane. </p>
<p>I haven't always loved poetry, but Nichita StÄƒnescu has definitely been a factor. Also, my Romanian teacher in college, Mrs. Stroe.</p>
